The name of the story is Clever Fish.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
One day, a fisherman was fishing to a river as usual.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He threw his net into the river and he just sat waiting there for fish to get in.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So that he could sell a lot of fish in the market and get some good money out of it.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
After some time, fisherman heard some rustle and bustle in the net, thinking that he must have got a lot of fish in the net.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He actually took out the net out of water.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But then, to his dismay, he saw just one tiny little fish in that net.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He grabbed hold of that fish.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But then suddenly, the fish started talking to him.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Tiny little fish set to the fisherman.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, fisherman, please, please, leave me, please, leave me.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Otherwise, I will die, I will die out of water.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But fisherman did not give any attention to the request of the fish.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But then, again, the tiny little fish set to the fisherman.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, fisherman, I will tell you something which is of your help.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you leave me back in water, I will tell all my friends about you and I will bring them near to the bank of river.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So that, when you come next time, you will have much more fish.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fisherman thought to himself, wow, that's not a bad deal at all.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He was thinking, if I let go one tiny little fish today, tomorrow, I will get a lot of more fish.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because this tiny little fish will bring all his friends to me.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Believing the word of this tiny little fish, Fisherman, let go this tiny little fish into the river again.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This tiny little fish was really happy and it swam away happily into the river never to come back.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Poor Fisherman.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He came next day, expecting that there will be a lot of fish that this tiny little fish would bring.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But that tiny little fish was very clever and because of his cleverness, he saved his life from this fisherman.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, children, moral of this story is you have to be really, really clever to save your life from such challenging moments.
