13000	18000	The name of the story is Clever Fish.
18000	26000	One day, a fisherman was fishing to a river as usual.
26000	34000	He threw his net into the river and he just sat waiting there for fish to get in.
34000	42000	So that he could sell a lot of fish in the market and get some good money out of it.
42000	55000	After some time, fisherman heard some rustle and bustle in the net, thinking that he must have got a lot of fish in the net.
56000	62000	He actually took out the net out of water.
62000	71000	But then, to his dismay, he saw just one tiny little fish in that net.
71000	74000	He grabbed hold of that fish.
74000	79000	But then suddenly, the fish started talking to him.
79000	82000	Tiny little fish set to the fisherman.
82000	88000	Oh, fisherman, please, please, leave me, please, leave me.
88000	93000	Otherwise, I will die, I will die out of water.
93000	100000	But fisherman did not give any attention to the request of the fish.
100000	106000	But then, again, the tiny little fish set to the fisherman.
106000	112000	Oh, fisherman, I will tell you something which is of your help.
112000	121000	If you leave me back in water, I will tell all my friends about you and I will bring them near to the bank of river.
121000	129000	So that, when you come next time, you will have much more fish.
129000	135000	Fisherman thought to himself, wow, that's not a bad deal at all.
135000	143000	He was thinking, if I let go one tiny little fish today, tomorrow, I will get a lot of more fish.
143000	150000	Because this tiny little fish will bring all his friends to me.
150000	160000	Believing the word of this tiny little fish, Fisherman, let go this tiny little fish into the river again.
160000	171000	This tiny little fish was really happy and it swam away happily into the river never to come back.
171000	173000	Poor Fisherman.
173000	182000	He came next day, expecting that there will be a lot of fish that this tiny little fish would bring.
182000	193000	But that tiny little fish was very clever and because of his cleverness, he saved his life from this fisherman.
193000	205000	So, children, moral of this story is you have to be really, really clever to save your life from such challenging moments.
