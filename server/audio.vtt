The name of the story is Clever Fish.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
One day, a fisherman was fishing to a river as usual.

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
He threw his net into the river and he just sat waiting there for fish to get in.

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
So that he could sell a lot of fish in the market and get some good money out of it.

00:42.000 --> 00:55.000
After some time, fisherman heard some rustle and bustle in the net, thinking that he must have got a lot of fish in the net.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
He actually took out the net out of water.

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
But then, to his dismay, he saw just one tiny little fish in that net.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
He grabbed hold of that fish.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
But then suddenly, the fish started talking to him.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Tiny little fish set to the fisherman.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, fisherman, please, please, leave me, please, leave me.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Otherwise, I will die, I will die out of water.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
But fisherman did not give any attention to the request of the fish.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
But then, again, the tiny little fish set to the fisherman.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Oh, fisherman, I will tell you something which is of your help.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
If you leave me back in water, I will tell all my friends about you and I will bring them near to the bank of river.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
So that, when you come next time, you will have much more fish.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
Fisherman thought to himself, wow, that's not a bad deal at all.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
He was thinking, if I let go one tiny little fish today, tomorrow, I will get a lot of more fish.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Because this tiny little fish will bring all his friends to me.

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
Believing the word of this tiny little fish, Fisherman, let go this tiny little fish into the river again.

02:40.000 --> 02:51.000
This tiny little fish was really happy and it swam away happily into the river never to come back.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Poor Fisherman.

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
He came next day, expecting that there will be a lot of fish that this tiny little fish would bring.

03:02.000 --> 03:13.000
But that tiny little fish was very clever and because of his cleverness, he saved his life from this fisherman.

03:13.000 --> 03:25.000
So, children, moral of this story is you have to be really, really clever to save your life from such challenging moments.
